Noah is driven by relentless curiosity to change the world, pioneering innovative solutions through interdisciplinary endeavors (e.g., business, technology, geopolitics, and philosophy).

Previously working at an innovative venture capital firm, he had the opportunity to work with some of the most exciting technologies shaping the future. The ability to identify real-world problems and create scalable solutions through technology was incredibly intriguing to him. Learning to build software that billions of people could use was a no-brainer; he needed to be a part of it as soon as possible.

While continuing his college journey, Noah began exploring software engineering on the side and soon realized he wanted to pursue it full-time. The decision to drop out and enroll in a bootcamp was once again, a no-brainer. Time is the most important resource to him, and he wanted to learn from the best in the world as soon as possible.

In his spare time, Noah practices a relentless curiosity towards the world. Whether this is studying history's greatest entrepreneurs, exploring the operations of a grocery store, reading science fiction, or 3D printing robots, these are the things that get him going.
