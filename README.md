### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a relentlessly curious software engineer who is on a mission to change the world through the integration of business, technology, and unlike fields. 

Last summer, I worked at an innovative venture capital firm and was given the opportunity to work alongside some of the most exciting technologies of our future. The ability to notice a problem in the real world and be able to create scalable solutions through technology was incredibly intriguing to me. Learning to build software that billions of people could use was a no-brainer; I needed to be a part of this as soon as possible.

As I was continuing my college journey, I started doing software engineering on the side and eventually realized that I wanted to do this full-time. The decision to drop out and enroll in a bootcamp was a no-brainer. Time is the most important resource to me, and I wanted to learn from the best in the world as soon as possible! 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning, learning, and more learning. Whether this is studying history's greatest entrepreneurs, exploring the operations of a grocery store for 3 hours, reading science fiction, or 3d printing robots, these are the things that get me going. One of my favorite philosophical mannerisms is â€˜donâ€™t be a sheep,â€™ which I tend to model much of my life after.

If you would like to chat, please feel free to reach out; my DMs are always open!
